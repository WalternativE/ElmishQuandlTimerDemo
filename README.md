# Stack.Fable.Timer.Demo

## Requirements

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 2.0.0 or higher
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4.8.2 or higher
* npm5: JS package manager

Although is not a Fable requirement, on macOS and Linux you'll need [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) for other F# tooling like Paket or editor support.

## Editor

The project can be used by editors compatible with the new .fsproj format, like VS Code + [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), Emacs with [fsharp-mode](https://github.com/fsharp/emacs-fsharp-mode) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). **Visual Studio for Mac** is also compatible but in the current version the package auto-restore function conflicts with Paket so you need to disable it: `Preferences > Nuget > General`.

## Building and running the app

* Install JS dependencies: `npm install`
* **Move to `src` folder**: `cd src`
* Install F# dependencies: `dotnet restore`
* Start Fable daemon and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) dev server: `dotnet fable npm-start`
* In your browser, open: http://localhost:8080/

> `dotnet fable yarn-start` (or `npm-start`) is used to start the Fable daemon and run a script in package.json concurrently. It's a shortcut of `yarn-run [SCRIP_NAME]`, e.g. `dotnet fable yarn-run start`.

If you are using VS Code + [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), you can also use the key combination: Ctrl+Shift+B (Cmd+Shift+B on macOS) instead of typing the `dotnet fable yarn-start` command. This also has the advantage that Fable-specific errors will be highlighted in the editor along with other F# errors.

Any modification you do to the F# code will be reflected in the web page after saving. When you want to output the JS code to disk, run `dotnet fable yarn-build` (or `npm-build`) and you'll get a minified JS bundle in the `public` folder.
